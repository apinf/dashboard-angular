### Folder Structure

The folder structure is a mix between [Angular 2 recommendation](https://johnpapa.net/angular-2-styles/) and [Meteor 1.3 recommendation](https://guide.meteor.com/structure.html).

### Client

The `client` folder contains single TypeScript (`.ts`) file which is the main file (`/client/app.component.ts`), and bootstrap's the Angular 2 application.

The main component uses HTML template and SASS file.

The `index.html` file is the main HTML which loads the application by using the main component selector (`<app>`).

All the other client files are under `client/imports` and organized by the context of the components (in our example, the context is `demo`).


### Server

The `server` folder contain single TypeScript (`.ts`) file which is the main file (`/server/main.ts`), and creates the main server instance, and the starts it.

All other server files should be located under `/server/imports`.
